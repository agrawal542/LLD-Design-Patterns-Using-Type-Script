# LLD Design Patterns Preparation Guide

This file tracks progress for key design patterns useful in Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews.  
Focus on what's most useful, skip what isn't.

## âœ… Creational Patterns (Must Know)

| Pattern   | Status     | Notes                                         |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Factory   | âœ… Learned  | Used to create instances based on type.       |
| Builder   | âœ… Learned  | For building complex objects step-by-step.    |
| Prototype | âœ… Learned  | For cloning existing instances.               |

## ðŸ”· Structural Patterns (Learn These Next)

| Pattern   | Status     | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adapter   | â¬œ Pending  | Converts one interface into another.                                  |
| Decorator | â¬œ Pending  | Adds behavior dynamically to objects.                                 |
| Composite | â¬œ Pending  | Tree structure: clients treat individual and composite objects alike. |

## ðŸ”¶ Behavioral Patterns (Must Learn for LLD)

| Pattern   | Status     | Notes                                                                     |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strategy  | âœ… Pending  | Defines a family of algorithms; selects one at runtime.                   |
| Observer  | â¬œ Pending  | One-to-many dependency; notifies all subscribers on state changes.        |
| Command   | â¬œ Pending  | Encapsulates a request as an object.                                     |
| State     | â¬œ Pending  | Allows object behavior to change with its internal state.                |
